              <h3>Undergraduate Research Symposium: The Relationship Between Transportation-related Air Pollution and Racial Demographics in Seattle, WA</h3>
              <p>
                I presented a group research project at the University of Washington's Undergraduate Research Symposium. Each year nearly 1,000 students from all three UW campuses and other local institutions present their research spanning over 100 disciplines.
              </p>
                Project Abstract: Research indicates that ethnic minority groups experience disproportionate exposure to air pollution caused by vehicular transportation. It is well known that differential exposure to air pollution causes increased health risks in vulnerable communities. Disparities in air pollution exposure are significant since they exacerbate comorbidities, increasing the risk of diseases like COVID-19. This study examined the relationship between exposure to Transportation-Related Air Pollution (TRAP) and census tract racial demographics in Seattle, WA. We hypothesized that communities with greater percentages of non-white residents are more likely than white-dominated communities to experience greater exposures to TRAP, because of historical factors such as “redlining”, segregation, and discrimination. This is because they are forced to live in less desirable areas and are unable to resist polluting infrastructure in their neighborhoods. We used the Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental Justice Database to relate diesel particulate matter (PM), a proxy for TRAP, to census tract demographics, from the 2020 U.S. census. We measured diesel PM concentrations at systematic distances along three North/South transects through Seattle, roughly corresponding with the location of Interstate 5 (I-5). Measurement locations were taken sufficiently far from I-5 so as to not be affected by I-5.

              <h3>Atlas Project: Examining How the Likelihood for Asthma-related 
                Hospitalizations Varies Across Different Races in California 
                Counties During 2019</h3>
              <p>
                For this project, I was expected to create a total of 5 maps to create an argument about any geospatial topic.
                I chose to examine the relationship between asthma-related hospitalizations and race within California. The primary criteria of this assignment
                was that I was expected to use two different methods of map-making. I used R Studio and QGIS to create these maps.

              <h3>Environmental Studies Capstone Project: How Altering Trawl Durations Can Save Nontarget Species</h3>
              <p>
                A requirement for the Environmental Studies major at the University of Washington is to complete a year-long capstone project. This project consists of an internship, a senior synthesis paper, and a presentation.
                For my capstone, I interned with NOAA Fisheries and performed video analysis on species interaction with trawl nets. The ultimate goal of my research was to mitigate the catch of non-target species by trawl nets.
                My presentation was selected as being in the top 10 best poster presentations and I was invited to present my research at the in-person Capstone Symposium.

              <h3>Environmental Studies Capstone Symposium: Top 10 Posters</h3>
              <p>
                Out of 55 poster presentations, I was one of the 10 that were chosen to present their poster again during the in-person poster highlights session!
                The Capstone Symposium was a great way to illustrate the breadth of knowledge and experience that I obtained during my time at the University of Washington.
